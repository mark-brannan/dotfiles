# resign-branch.sh — re-sign a PR branch's commits with this machine's key,
# rebase it onto the tip of the default branch, and force-push it.
#
# Why this exists: commits get made unsigned on paths that skip
# commit.gpgsign — Claude Code cloud sessions (no key on the VM; upstream
# closed https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/7711 "not planned"),
# plumbing like `git commit-tree`, and any `-c commit.gpgsign=false`. A repo
# whose ruleset requires signed commits blocks the PR until every commit on
# it verifies. This is the remedy, run once from a machine that has the key.
#
# Usage:
#   resign-branch.sh <branch> [<remote>]     remote defaults to origin
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. fetches <remote>/<branch> into a throwaway worktree, so the checkout
#      you run it from never changes branch (refuses if <branch> in any
#      clone of the repo on this machine has commits the remote lacks —
#      they would be orphaned)
#   2. resolves the rebase target: the base branch of the open PR for
#      <branch>, so a stacked PR stays stacked; the default branch when
#      no PR is open. RESIGN_BASE=<name> overrides the lookup
#   3. if every commit already verifies, every commit is authored as this
#      machine's user.email, there are no merge commits and the branch is
#      up to date with the base, exits 0 without touching anything —
#      safe to run repeatedly
#   4. otherwise, with a local signing key: rebases onto the base with -S,
#      which re-signs every commit, reauthors any commit not authored as
#      this machine's user.email (original identity kept as a
#      Co-Authored-By trailer), drops any "Update branch" merge commits and
#      brings the branch up to date — a signed, linear stand-in for
#      GitHub's "Update branch" button; a conflict aborts the rebase and
#      exits 1, branch untouched. Refuses if linearizing would drop content
#      from a hand-resolved merge.
#      Without a local key: replays each commit as a GitHub-API-signed
#      commit (GraphQL createCommitOnBranch) on a scratch branch, one API
#      commit per original commit, each attributed to the `gh` token's
#      account with the original author kept as a Co-Authored-By trailer
#      (the API has no author-override field, so this path cannot reauthor
#      to this machine's user.email the way the local-key path does).
#      Refuses if the branch has merge commits, or any commit changes a
#      file's executable bit, adds/removes a symlink or submodule, or does
#      anything else createCommitOnBranch's additions/deletions can't
#      express — resolve those by hand or from a machine with a local key.
#   5. verifies every rewritten commit (locally on the key path, via the
#      GitHub API's verification.verified on the fallback), then
#      force-pushes with lease
#
# Rewrites history. Single-author PR branches only; it refuses to run
# against the default branch.
#
# A commit can carry a locally-valid signature and still fail GitHub's
# check with reason "unknown_key" -- not because the key is wrong, but
# because the commit's author/committer email (e.g. a cloud session's
# noreply@anthropic.com) belongs to a different GitHub account than the
# one this key is registered to. Local `git log --pretty=%G?` reports
# such a commit "good" regardless -- it checks the signature against
# allowed_signers, not against GitHub's email-to-account mapping -- so
# that check alone under-detects this case. Any commit whose author or
# committer email isn't this machine's user.email gets reauthored to it
# (original identity preserved as a Co-Authored-By trailer) in the same
# pass that resigns.
#
# No local key: GitHub API fallback. When user.signingkey is unset, commits
# are rebuilt one-for-one through the `createCommitOnBranch` GraphQL
# mutation, which GitHub signs itself (verification reason "valid"). The
# mutation only knows additions and plain-blob deletions -- no merges, no
# executable bit, no symlinks, no submodules, no author override -- so a
# branch that needs any of those is refused rather than silently
# mishandled, and every resulting commit is attributed to the `gh` token's
# account with the original author preserved as a Co-Authored-By trailer,
# never reauthored to this machine's user.email (the API has no field for
# that). The rewrite happens on a scratch branch on the remote so the real
# branch is only ever touched by the final force-with-lease push.
