name: wrapup
description: Close a session — write the narrative log to the right state repo, list the issues the session opened or labelled, and end with a paste-ready hand-off prompt. Use when Solace says "wrap up", "log it", "hand off", "hand-off prompt", "call it there", or when a session is ending with work still open.

# Wrapping up

The Stop hook (`stop-continuity.sh`) already writes the session record, the
typed decision log and an auto-checkpoint, then commits and pushes the state
repo — every Stop, unprompted. Don't redo any of that by hand and don't wait
to be asked. This skill covers what only you can write: what the session
meant, what is still open, and how the next one starts.

## 1. Where state lands

Settled 2026-08-19. A project's session state stays in that project's own
repo. Never stage one project's work under another's.

| Work | State goes to |
|---|---|
| Symphony | `~/symphony/intermediate_files/claude_slop/` (`kanban.md` + `log.md`). Its human-facing `maintenance/log.md` and `priorities.md` get only finished, high-level results. |
| Global and cross-cutting — standing orders, rules, hooks, Claude tooling, anything spanning projects | The private repo `~/claude_prompts_scratch`, under `state/global/kanban.md` and `state/global/log/`. Work on `main` there; `git pull --rebase` before pushing. |
| Any project with no private repo of its own | The same global paths. |
| Dotfiles | **Never** — it is public, and session notes name boats, hosts and services. Dotfiles has no board of its own: its loops are dotfiles issues, or cards on the global board when they have no GitHub home. |
| Any other project with its own board | That repo, at the path its CLAUDE.md names. |

## 2. Narrative log

Write `log/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` under the state directory above. The
auto-checkpoint records what happened; only you can record what it meant
and what should happen next. The machine one is evidence, not a substitute.
Put in it:

- what was decided, and why — as a link to where each decision landed (the
  Q-nn footnote, the ADR, the closed issue, the PR), including calls that
  reversed or narrowed an earlier one. The log holds the link, not a copy;
- what was tried and abandoned, so the next session doesn't retry it;
- what comes next: the hand-off prompt from step 4, verbatim;
- observations worth keeping. They go here, silently — never as an aside in
  chat.

## 3. Issues

List the issues this session opened or labelled: one line each, with its
link. Nothing else — no sweep of the board, no card batch to accept or
delete, no checking what merged. State lives on GitHub and `worklist`
reads it; a wrap-up that edits it is a second copy. Routing and format:
`/card-write`.

## 4. Hand-off prompt

When the session ends with work still to do, write the prompt that starts
the next one. It must:

- be **ready to paste** — no "as discussed", no context the reader has to
  supply;
- name the **branch, PR, file, card, etc.** it acts on;
- carry **links, not state adjectives** — `#42`, not "PR #42 (merged, CI
  green)". State is read live at the other end; written down it is stale by
  the time it's read;
- **never ask Solace to review or merge.** The PR is where that lives, and
  `worklist` shows him when it is his turn;
- name a **recommended model and difficulty (effort) setting** — both,
  every time, e.g. `Model: opus · Effort: high`. A hand-off prompt missing
  either is not finished;
- be written so somebody who was not in this session can act on it.

Put it in the narrative log as well as the chat. The log survives; the chat
does not.

## 5. The closing message

End with a prompt, not a status bullet or observation. A closing that reads
"the vague thing is borked, your call" costs a read and returns nothing
actionable. The closing message holds exactly two things: the hand-off
prompt, and links to the `needs-ruling` issues awaiting Solace. Nothing else
goes in it.
