name: agora
description: Run an agora sitting — the quick decisions, in batch, one fresh subagent per item, the user rules. Use on "/agora", "walk the decision cards", "what needs deciding", or when the user says they have the headspace to rule on a queue of open decisions. Not for toil; that is grind. Not for a hard multi-turn question; "confer" is a closed answer here, and it sends the item to a one-off confer session, never straight to a curia.

# Agora

The user's analogue of grind: the sitting in which the quick judgment items
are consumed in batch. Each item is quick by construction; a hard one is
answered with the one word **confer**, the sitting moves past it, and it
goes to a one-off confer session of its own — not a curia. A curia opens
only at the gates in the curia skill, on the user's word in that confer.
This skill absorbs the retired `/ruling`: the typed per-item contract below was ruling's.

Ancestor concepts: GTD inbox processing, office hours, a replenishment
cadence; the ruling's default that holds is "act after a veto window".

## The sitting

<!-- Sourcing is settled in design (awake items from the ruling items);
     the awake/asleep mechanism (worklist rung 3) is not built. Until
     then: -->

Pull candidates from the state repo's items with `owner=human-ruling`
(`work-item list | awk -F'\t' '$2 == "human-ruling" && $3 == "ready"'`,
since an open or held item cannot be claimed and a blocked one waits
on its `until=`; the card line is
the last column, the id the first), anything `/reconcile`
flagged as an implicit "Pending:" tail, and anything the user names. That
list is the **agora-docket**. Count it before the first question, and show
the count on every question. <!-- When worklist awake/asleep lands, filter
to awake only. -->

**Admission** (pencil, the agent's proposal in the one-entry-point
curia's §6, "The agora petition"; not ruled). Each candidate passes one
test: could the user rule on it from the card alone, with no prior
context? If not, a subagent writes a brief and only then admits it. The
brief is a file, `state/global/agora/briefs/<card-id>.md`, and the card
gains its link (`work-item brief <id> -`, fed the text under `## Brief` in
`work-item show <id>`, less its `points:` line, plus the link), so the
card stays one line, the context has one home, and the next sitting
reuses it. A card whose question events have overtaken never reaches the
user: restate the live question under it, or route it
to `/sweep`. "May I delete this?" is never the item. The docket is counted
after admission; a card routed away leaves the count.

**The brief** follows [brief.md](brief.md), which `/scoping` shares;
read it before writing one.

Where the item touches the user depends on its kind:

| Kind | Touches the user at | The brief carries |
|---|---|---|
| Risk appetite | an action they take | the moment, the incident, each answer's cost |
| Technical design | what they live with later | the crux in one line; failures, upkeep, CI, agent reach |
| Values and voice | how it reads | rendered examples |
| Money, law, people | outside the screen | numbers measured or guessed; who sees it; one-way door? |
| A family of items | one context, many rulings | the shared brief once, each item a one-line delta |
| A default in force | it is already happening | "object or let stand", with what it has done |

A fold also carries the curia's question in one line.

## Per item: the contract

Every item this skill touches gets, and keeps:

- **Input** — the exact question, one sentence, answerable yes / no / a
  number / a named choice, plus the four fields `default`, `undo`,
  `until`, `risk`. Not "figure out X"; that is unscoped work, sent back
  to be scoped.
- **Output** — exactly one of:
  - **Ruling** — the user answers; the ruling is written at once to
    `docs/decisions.md` in the primary repo, or the state repo's log if it
    fails the private-terms check. The card retires in the same turn, the
    ruling being the user's acceptance (pencil, the lifecycle's reading):
    `work-item claim <id>`, `work-item log <id> status=done
    'evidence=<link>'`, then `work-item log <id> status=closed
    'accepted=<link>'`, both links to where the answer is recorded (the
    decisions line, the spawned work, the curia's open question), per [the lifecycle](../../../docs/work-item-lifecycle.md).
    A refused `claim` leaves the card as it is; a `done` that fails after
    the claim takes `work-item release <id>`; a `closed` that fails is
    retried, since `list` hides a card left at `done`. Each failure goes in
    the output line. A candidate with no item (a "Pending:" tail, one the
    user named) has nothing to retire; the ruling's record is its output.
  - **Spawned work item** — the answer was "build X to find out"; open
    the issue or card, link it, this item retires as a ruling does.
  - **Item (partly) unblocked** — the ruling removes one dependency; say
    which, and what still blocks (`work-item log <id> 'unblocked: <which>,
    still blocked by <what>'`; single-quoted, with no `=` in the words,
    since a `status=` or `owner=` word moves the item).
  - **Confer** — the user's one word; the item leaves the sitting for a
    one-off confer session (see below). Not a failure of the item; a
    rating of its difficulty and possibly of the question's quality.
    Not a curia: the agora is the second of the curia skill's gates, and
    the sitting never passes the later ones.
    Confer keeps the card open and works it further; never offer it
    paired with closing or deleting.
  - **Folded** — the item is a sub-question of an open curia; a yes writes
    it under that curia's `## Open questions` with its provenance, and
    the card retires as a ruling does. No folder is touched beyond that
    line.

## Per item: the steps

1. A fresh subagent gathers the item's context, starting from
   `work-item show <id>` (a confer mark or an unblocked note lives in its
   log, not on the docket row), and returns the typed
   question with its four fields and a **direct link** to the stored
   context, readable by the user. It also lists the open curiae exactly as
   the curia skill's bare `/curia` does (`status: open` in the header; a
   header-less digest is open) and says whether the item is a
   sub-question of one; if so the pick is "fold
   into `<id>`" and the outcome is **Folded**. A subagent has no channel
   to the user, so it never asks; it only prepares. <!-- Context budget and
   return format: open (design doc, open question on the agora
   procedure). -->
2. The sitting checks the brief is still true: a link it read that changed
   after its `read_at` (`gh ... --json updatedAt`, `git log -1`) sends it
   back to a subagent for a fresh brief. Then it shows the brief and asks
   the question in one `AskUserQuestion` dialog, `multiSelect` when
   outcomes combine (fold and rule): the agent's pick first and why, then
   the alternatives. Every question carries **X of Y** and the total.
   Nothing else from the subagent enters the sitting's context.
3. The user rules: yes / no / a value / **confer** / other.
4. Apply the output per the contract, immediately; don't batch.
5. Discard the subagent. Next item.

## Confer: handing a hard item to a confer session

On the word *confer*: record it on the card
(<!-- format open; this is its pencil form -->
`work-item log <id> confer=<YYYY-MM-DD>`), leave the card where it is,
and move on. **Create nothing under `state/global/curia/`.** A curia question
petitions the agora first; no lower-level session creates a curia. The
agora is one gate of several; a curia opens only when
the user says so inside the confer session, at the curia skill's gates.

At the end of the sitting, print one confer prompt per deferred item,
ready to paste, each naming model and effort:

```
Confer on <short name>: <the card's question, one sentence> (<card link>).
A one-off session — a few rounds of question and answer, one at a time.
It ends in a ruling, a spawned issue or a sharper card; open no curia
unless the user says so, and then only through the gates in the curia
skill. Model: fable · Effort: high
```

The sitting never opens the hard discussion itself; that would bloat its
context.

## Difficulty and model

Before the first item, rate each candidate twice from its `default:` /
`risk:` text, as a triage table does: the user's difficulty and a
high-stakes agent's, each low / medium / high. If the running model is
weaker than the hardest agent rating calls for, print one line offering a
model switch or an `Agent` call with a `model` override for that item,
then continue.

## Output

Per item: the question, the outcome, the link. At the end, one line:
how many ruled, spawned, unblocked, folded, deferred to a confer, still
open, out of the docket's total.

## Open (design doc, open question on the agora procedure)

- Awake/asleep filter: depends on worklist rung 3.
- Subagent context budget and return format.
- How a confer deferral is recorded on the card.
- Where the confer session's own record lands when it rules without a curia.
- Where rulings land when the item has no obvious home repo.
