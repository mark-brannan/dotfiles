name: agora
description: Run an agora sitting — the quick decisions, in batch, one fresh subagent per item, Solace rules. Use on "/agora", "walk the decision cards", "what needs deciding", or when Solace says they have the headspace to rule on a queue of open decisions. Not for toil; that is grind. Not for a hard multi-turn question; "confer" is a closed answer here, and it sends the item to a one-off confer session, never straight to a curia.

# Agora

Solace's analogue of grind: the sitting in which the quick judgment items
are consumed in batch. Each item is quick by construction; a hard one is
answered with the one word **confer**, the sitting moves past it, and it
goes to a one-off confer session of its own — not a curia. A curia opens
only at the gates in the curia skill, on Solace's word in that confer.
This skill absorbs `/ruling` (retired by Solace, 2026-09-29, in the design
confer): the typed per-item contract below was ruling's.

Ancestor concepts: GTD inbox processing, office hours, a replenishment
cadence; the ruling's default that holds is "act after a veto window".

## The sitting

<!-- Sourcing is settled in design (awake items from the board's
     ## Needs ruling); the awake/asleep mechanism (worklist rung 3) is not
     built. Until then: -->

Pull candidates from `## Needs ruling` in kanban.md, anything `/reconcile`
flagged as an implicit "Pending:" tail, and anything Solace names. That
list is the **agora-docket**. Count it before the first question, and show
the count on every question. <!-- When worklist awake/asleep lands, filter
to awake only. -->

## Per item: the contract

Every item this skill touches gets, and keeps:

- **Input** — the exact question, one sentence, answerable yes / no / a
  number / a named choice, plus the four fields `default`, `undo`,
  `until`, `risk`. Not "figure out X"; that is unscoped work, sent back
  to be scoped.
- **Output** — exactly one of:
  - **Ruling** — Solace answers; written at once to `docs/decisions.md`
    in the primary repo, or the state repo's log if it fails the
    private-terms check.
  - **Spawned work item** — the answer was "build X to find out"; open
    the issue or card, link it, this item closes.
  - **Item (partly) unblocked** — the ruling removes one dependency; say
    which, and what still blocks.
  - **Confer** — Solace's one word; the item leaves the sitting for a
    one-off confer session (see below). Not a failure of the item; a
    rating of its difficulty and possibly of the question's quality.
    Not a curia: the agora is the second of the curia skill's gates, and
    the sitting never passes the later ones.
  - **Folded** — the item is a sub-question of an open curia; a yes writes
    it under that curia's `## Open questions` with its provenance, and
    the card closes. No folder is touched beyond that line.

## Per item: the steps

1. A fresh subagent gathers the item's context and returns the typed
   question with its four fields and a **direct link** to the stored
   context, readable by Solace. It also lists the open curiae exactly as
   the curia skill's bare `/curia` does (`status: open` in the header; a
   redirect collapses into its target) and says whether the item is a
   sub-question of one; if so the pick is "fold
   into `<id>`" and the outcome is **Folded**. A subagent has no channel
   to Solace, so it never asks; it only prepares. <!-- Context budget and
   return format: open (design doc, open question on the agora
   procedure). -->
2. The sitting asks that question, as returned, in one `AskUserQuestion`
   dialog: the agent's pick first and why, then the alternatives. Every
   question carries **X of Y** and the total. Nothing else from the
   subagent enters the sitting's context.
3. Solace rules: yes / no / a value / **confer** / other.
4. Apply the output per the contract, immediately; don't batch.
5. Discard the subagent. Next item.

## Confer: handing a hard item to a confer session

On the word *confer*: record it on the card (<!-- format open -->
`confer: <YYYY-MM-DD>`), leave the card where it is, and move on. **Create
nothing under `state/global/curia/`.** "It must go to the agora first
... Creation of curia by lower level sessions is forbidden" (Solace,
2026-09-29). The agora is one gate of several; a curia opens only when
Solace says so inside the confer session, at the curia skill's gates.

At the end of the sitting, print one confer prompt per deferred item,
ready to paste, each naming model and effort:

```
Confer on <short name>: <the card's question, one sentence> (<card link>).
A one-off session — a few rounds of question and answer, one at a time.
It ends in a ruling, a spawned issue or a sharper card; open no curia
unless Solace says so, and then only through the gates in the curia
skill. Model: fable · Effort: high
```

The sitting never opens the hard discussion itself; that would bloat its
context.

## Difficulty and model

Before the first item, rate each candidate twice from its `default:` /
`risk:` text, as a triage table does: Solace's difficulty and a
high-stakes agent's, each low / medium / high. If the running model is
weaker than the hardest agent rating calls for, print one line offering a
model switch or an `Agent` call with a `model` override for that item,
then continue.

## Output

Per item: the question, the outcome, the link. At the end, one line:
how many ruled, spawned, unblocked, folded, deferred to a confer, still
open, out of the docket's total.

## Open (design doc, open question on the agora procedure)

- Awake/asleep filter: depends on worklist rung 3.
- Subagent context budget and return format.
- How a confer deferral is recorded on the card.
- Where the confer session's own record lands when it rules without a curia.
- Where rulings land when the item has no obvious home repo.
