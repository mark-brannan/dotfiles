# Blocks the end of a session on a branch that is ahead of the default branch
# with neither a PR nor a pointer -- a card on the global board or an open
# issue that names it.
#
# Why: twice in one week real design work was lost to a branch that was
# pushed, never opened as a PR, and pointed at from nowhere durable. The Stop
# hook records *unpushed* commits, so a pushed orphan trips no alarm, and
# `worklist` lists stranded branches at the bottom where nobody acts on them.
# Detection is not closure. Ruled 2026-09-09 (Solace): a PR is not required
# for every branch, but until one exists a pointer must -- a board card or an
# open issue naming the branch and what it holds.
#
# Runs on Stop, alongside kanban-gate.sh and pr-threads-gate.sh. The quiet
# path costs nothing: HEAD on the default branch, a detached HEAD, no origin,
# or no commits ahead and the hook exits before any network call.
#
# Read-only: this hook only detects and blocks. It used to also delete a
# branch on request (`abandon`); that authorized a destructive action from
# the session's own last assistant message, which review on PR #114 flagged
# as an injection surface -- content Claude reads mid-session could in
# principle steer it into emitting that line unprompted. Split out to
# abandon-branch.sh (dotfiles#115), left disconnected until record-vs-delete
# and skill-vs-hook are decided.
#
# Two outcomes:
#   pass      a PR, a board card or an open issue names the branch
#   block     once per session, with the branch, what was searched, and the
#             two ways out
#
# Blocks at most once per session (a marker beside the notes file under
# TMPDIR, the same convention pr-ownership-context.sh uses for its record --
# NOT under the state dir, which stop-continuity.sh commits and pushes, so a
# per-session marker there would be repo churn in every session). A gate that
# can trap a session is worse than no gate.
#
# GATE: no jq, no gh, gh failing or unauthenticated -> block once saying the
# branch could not be verified. A guard that goes quiet when it cannot look is
# indistinguishable from one that looked and found nothing.

block "branch-home-gate: this session cannot end yet. Branch \`$branch\` in $repo is $ahead commit(s) ahead of $base with no PR and no pointer: no PR has this head, no open issue names the branch, and no card on the board does either.

Take one of the two ways out, then end the turn again:
  - open the PR (not draft), or
  - file a pointer card (/card-write) naming the branch and what it holds -- a card on the global board or an open issue, either counts.

Detection is not closure -- a pushed branch nobody points at is how two pieces of design work were lost. This gate fires once per session."
