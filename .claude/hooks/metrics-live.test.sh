# What matters is that the nag is edge-triggered: a line fires once when its
# counter first crosses, and then not again until the next line. Three
# properties, one per case in issue #111's Verification section:
#
#   crossing    a transcript that grows past 100k then past 150k produces
#               exactly two context lines, in that order, and the second one
#               says to propose stopping
#   the gap     a gap over 30 minutes between prompts starts a new sitting, so
#               the 60-minute line does not fire on a clock that began before
#               the gap -- and a short gap leaves that clock running
#   the clock    prompts own it outright: a Stop or a SubagentStop never starts
#               it, never moves it and never reads it out, so a session whose
#               first wired event is a Stop is sitting for zero minutes
#   the Stop    a Stop on an archivable session past the line blocks once with
#               one instruction, then passes with the resume-block message, and
#               every Stop after that carries only the block's age
#
# The transcripts are built here rather than committed: each one exists to hold
# a single usage number, and a fixture file would say less than the generator.

# writing $OUT and reaching the display check. If that delete lands in the
# window, the display must still open with the block -- it comes from
# $metrics/$merged in memory now, not a re-read of the cache file.
#
# A clean, pushed repo of its own -- not $REPO, which carries the leftover
# "dirty" file from test 3 onward. archivable() short-circuits on a dirty
# worktree before it ever shells out to `gh`, so reusing $REPO would let this
# test pass on the timing of the script's own subprocess spawns rather than
# on the slow `gh` mock it's actually exercising.
