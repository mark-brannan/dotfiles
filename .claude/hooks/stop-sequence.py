"""Stop hook: run stop-continuity.sh, then metrics-live.sh's Stop readout.

Claude Code runs every matching hook in parallel. Run as two entries, the
📦 notice computed its own "archivable" while stop-continuity.sh was still
salvaging and committing, so the checkpoint and the notice could answer the
same question two ways in one Stop. In sequence there is one verdict:
stop-continuity.sh writes it to the metrics record, and metrics-live.sh reads
it back, refusing one older than STOP_VERDICT_SINCE, the moment this started.

Fails open, like both hooks it runs: a timeout or crash in the first still
lets the second speak, and the second then reports that no verdict came.
Only metrics-live.sh's stdout is passed through; it is the one that emits
the notice and the block.
