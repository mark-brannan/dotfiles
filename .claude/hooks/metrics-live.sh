# Recompute the session's metrics NOW and cache them where the statusline can
# read them without paying for the computation itself.
#
# Why a cache file at all: `session-metrics.jq` slurps the whole transcript,
# which is fine a few times a turn but not on every statusline render (those
# fire several times a second). The statusline just prints what is already on
# disk, and recomputes only past its own staleness age.
#
# Three wirings, and only three: UserPromptSubmit (silent readout, may carry a
# crossing line), Stop and SubagentStop. It used to be wired to nine events,
# eight of them with `show`, which meant a jq pass over the transcript after
# every single tool call and a readout that spoke often enough to be tuned
# out. That is a level-triggered nag. What replaced it is the crossing engine
# below: a line fires once, when a threshold is first crossed, and then says
# nothing until the next line.
#
# One file per session, keyed by session_id: parallel sessions are normal
# here, and per-session paths mean two of them never write the same file.
# The rollup that merges them (`metrics/metrics.json`) is *generated* and
# gitignored -- it is never committed, so there is no shared file for two
# sessions to collide on. See metrics-rollup.sh.
#
# stdin: any hook payload carrying transcript_path/session_id/cwd.
# Always exits 0.
#
# FROZEN -- THAW CAREFULLY. Every block below tagged with that phrase (the
# ⛁ context (» below the first rung; ¢ and ○ were the other candidates),
# ⚖ gate, ⚡ friction and ⏱ sitting-clock crossings, and any glyph
# family added alongside them) is frozen: do not modify without direct,
# explicit interaction with Solace.
#
# Changes here are small and contained -- one glyph/family at a time. Never
# a wholesale rewrite: don't drop an existing glyph, family, or behavior
# without her explicit call to drop it. That includes cadence: don't make
# a line fire less often, coalesce, dedupe, or go quiet as a "cleanup" --
# she has said explicitly she wants this louder and more frequent, not
# calmer. Edge-triggered (once per new crossing) is the floor, not a ceiling
# to defend; if a change would make the reader see this line less, it is
# out of scope for a "small, contained" edit and needs to be asked about.
#
# Before touching any of these lines: propose it visually in-chat first --
# rendered before/after examples, not a description of the change. Before
# merging: the PR description carries those same rendered examples. Prose
# alone does not satisfy this.

#             The line repeats its glyph once per threshold rung crossed this
#             session (capped at 5, then "(xN)"), and the ladder extends past
#             the last configured line by CONTEXT_STEP forever, so it keeps
#             escalating instead of going quiet at the top. At or above
#             CONTEXT_STOP_AT it also reaches the model: once as an offer to
#             stop, and plainly, not repeated, on every rung after that
#   sitting   elapsed, context, verdict -- driven entirely by prompts: it
#             starts at the first one, restarts when the gap between two of
#             them runs past SIT_GAP_MIN (a session picked up after dinner is
#             a new sitting, not a nine-hour one), and is never read or moved
#             by a Stop. 60 min says stand up, 120 says stop here and wrap up.
#             The clock itself is machine-wide, not per session -- three open
#             chats are still one chair -- while the line is reported once per
#             session, so each chat says it where its user is reading
#   friction  corrections and rebukes inside a window of human turns; the one
#             line that goes to the model rather than to the screen, since the
