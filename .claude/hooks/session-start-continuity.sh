# SessionStart hook: hand the session its board and its recent history.
#
# The standing orders say new sessions open by pulling from a board. That only
# happens reliably if the board is already in front of the session -- asking
# Claude to go find it costs a prompt from the user, which is the thing this is
# supposed to remove. So this reads the state repo and injects a short brief.
#
# Deliberately terse. Every line here is charged to every session in every
# repo, so it carries only what changes what the session does first: open
# work, what the last sessions left behind, and how much deciding the user has
# already been asked to do this week.
#
# The board is not read here. It used to be: the first 16 bullets of
# kanban.md, half of them ticked, ~4 KB into every session, and a bullet
# above the first heading never printed at all. `worklist --brief` owns that
# view now -- live PR and issue state plus the `## Claude's` cards, <= 3 KB by
# its contract, served from cache so it is fast. This hook only caps the wait
# at 6 s (a hung gh call must never hold session start) and clips the output
# at 4 KB, so a broken worklist cannot become a 40 KB tax. Missing worklist
# is reported, not worked around; the old dump is not a fallback.
#
# Never clones. A private clone needs credentials a hook cannot count on and
# would stall session start on the network; absence is reported with the fix
# instead of silently papered over.

## Continuity: state repo NOT available

`claude_prompts_scratch` is not checked out here, so the board, the prior
checkpoints and the metrics are all missing, and `stop-continuity.sh` will
write to `~/.claude/state/global` (local, unpushed, lost when this container
is reclaimed).

Fix it now: `mcp__Claude_Code_Remote__add_repo` with owner `mark-brannan`,
repo `claude_prompts_scratch`, access `push`, then clone it to
`/workspace/claude_prompts_scratch` -- a path `state_repo` already searches.
Do this every cold session; there is no environment setting that does it for
you. Cloud environments configure only name, network access, environment
variables and a setup script -- repositories attach per session, and the
GitHub proxy 403s any repo not attached, so a setup script cannot clone this.
