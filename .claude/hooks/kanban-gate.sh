# Blocks the end of a turn while the state repo's kanban.md carries an
# uncommitted change that breaks the board contract.
#
# Why: kanban-lint.sh already runs on every Edit/Write of a board, but a
# board can also change through a Bash heredoc, a sed, or a script, and
# stop-continuity.sh commits and pushes the state repo at every Stop. A bad
# card written at 23:59 is in git history by 00:00 with nobody having read
# it. So, in the pr-threads-gate.sh pattern, the turn is not allowed to end
# until the added lines pass the lint -- the same lint, --diff mode, so only
# what this session wrote is judged and history on the board is left alone.
#
# Blocks at most once per turn: the harness sets stop_hook_active on the
# retry, and a second block would only loop.
#
# GATE: no state repo here means nothing to gate (exit 0 -- a cloud session
# without the private clone is reported at SessionStart, not here). But a
# dirty board that cannot be linted -- kanban-lint.sh missing, awk gone,
# the lint itself failing -- blocks and says so. A gate that goes quiet
# when it cannot look is indistinguishable from one that looked and found
# nothing.
