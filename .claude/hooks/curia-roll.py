"""UserPromptSubmit, PostToolUse(AskUserQuestion): append the user's words, verbatim, to the roll of the
curia this session is sitting in.

The curia skill writes state/global/curia/<id>/LIVE at the start of a sitting,
holding the session id and a timestamp. A session named in some LIVE file is
sitting in that curia, and every prompt it receives is appended to that
folder's roll.md as one entry:

    ### 20261002t054107z
    ````
    <the prompt, byte for byte>
    ````

The fence is one backtick longer than the longest run of backticks in the
prompt (three at least), so a heading or a ``` inside the prompt stays inside
the entry. The heading is the bare stamp: UTC date and time to the second with
no separators and a lower-case `t` and `z`, so GitHub's anchor for the entry is
`#20261002t054107z` and a reference to it is `<curia>/roll.md#<stamp>`
(Solace, 2026-10-02; the session id was dropped from the heading the same
day). A newline is always added after the prompt before the closing fence:
strip exactly one to get the prompt back.

The prompt that opens a sitting, `/curia <id> ...`, arrives before the skill
writes LIVE, so it is matched by the id it names instead. Task notifications
and agent messages also fire UserPromptSubmit and stay out. A dialog's
free-text answers and notes are one entry; a picked label stays out.

The roll is append-only (one-entry-point curia, 2026-10-02, the words log),
save that words sharing a stamp are one entry, joined by a blank line, as
build-roll.py merges them (Solace, 2026-10-02). Until a curia's
folder is moved to the roll/digest layout, roll.md is still the curated
document, so a folder without digest.md is skipped.

Always exits 0 and prints nothing: a roll failure must never block a prompt,
and UserPromptSubmit stdout would land in the model's context.
