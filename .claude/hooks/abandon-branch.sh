#!/bin/sh
# Deletes a branch locally and on its remote, deliberately.
#
# NOT WIRED UP. This is the abandon half that used to live inside
# branch-home-gate.sh (split out in dotfiles#115); nothing calls this script
# yet, on purpose. branch-home-gate.sh's own `abandon` outcome was flagged in
# review (PR #114) as an injection surface: it authorized this same deletion
# from the session's own last assistant message, which content Claude reads
# mid-session could in principle steer without the user having said so.
# Whether this becomes a skill (explicit invocation), gets wired back into a
# hook, or moves to a record-now/delete-at-sweep model is still open --
# dotfiles#115 tracks the decision. Until then, run it by hand.
#
# Usage: abandon-branch.sh [-C <path>] [<branch>]
#   -C <path>   the repo to act in (default: cwd)
#   <branch>    the branch to delete (default: the one checked out at <path>)
#
# Refuses in $HOME (yadm gate); only deletes the local branch once the
# remote side is a confirmed absence or a confirmed deletion, never on an
# indeterminate ls-remote (network, auth, a dead remote).
